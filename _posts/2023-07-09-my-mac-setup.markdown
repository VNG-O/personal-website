# My mac setup

Having recently moved over to Mac OS from Windows, I found that there were a few ajustments I needed to make with the way I worked.

Getting used to Mac OS itself was quite easy but I found a few features or behaviours strange.

Here are some of the apps I installed during my first year with Mac OS:

1. Hidden bar
2. Anphetamine
3. Mos
4. Maccy
5. One Menu
6. VLC (of course)
7. TinkerTool
8. Choosy
9. Rectangle
10. Google Drive
11. One Drive
